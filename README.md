### Rational Arithmetic:

C++ Program support Rational Arithmetic.

### MasterMind Game:

A 2-player game, master & breaker, breaker repeatedly guesses a code made by master, then receives feedback about the guess.

### Tree String:

An ADT for strings with a tree-like structure, this representation of a string can be used for very large strings need to be modiÔ¨Åed often in different places.

### Polynomial Arithmetic:
Build on the rational classes, represents and performs operations on single variable polynomials.

### Compute Expression:
read the string representation of expressions, then evaluate arithmetic expressions contains simple unary and binary operations, variables.  It also has pretty print and deep copy functions for expressions.
